### **Project Name:**

# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

#### About Project:

- Sorting is this process of arranging a collection of elements in numerical or lexiographical order, either ascending or descending.

- This is a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer implemented using C programming language with GUI.

- It helps in visualising how different sorts work and also gives an idea of how fast they are.

- Sorts included in this projects are :

  1. Bubble Sort
  2. Selection Sort

  **For Windows** , Visual Studio is required, any suggestions on how to compile CSFML on windows are most welcome :).

#### Technologies Used:

- C
- CSFML

#### How it works?

- The coloured line in the white bars shows on which element the sorting is taking place and how the element is getting sorted.
- After doing sorting logically according to the respective sorts, it moves to next element.
- Once the array is sorted, all the bars gets light up with different color.
